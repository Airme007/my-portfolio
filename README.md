# my-portfolio

Hi, I'm Emmanuel â€” a web developer and aspiring software engineer.

This portfolio highlights the work I've done as I grow in web development. I built this site to share my journey, showcase my projects, and connect with like-minded people.

This site is built with HTML and CSS. I focused on clean design and accessibility, aiming for a simple but professional presentation of my skills.

I'm currently learning HTML and CSS, and I plan to add interactive features soon.


##  Tech Stack
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS (with responsive design)
- Hosted with GitHub Pages (optional)

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Plan to Add Next
- JavaScript for dynamic interactions
- A blog section
- Theme switcher (dark/light mode)

Thank you for checking out my site!
